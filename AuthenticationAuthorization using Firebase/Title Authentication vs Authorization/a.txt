Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It checks who the user is

Example:
When you log in to a website with your email and password, the system is authenticating you.

If your credentials match what's stored in the database, you're allowed in.

Authorization
Authorization is the process of checking what actions or resources a user has permission to access after theyâ€™ve been authenticated.

After you log in, if you're an admin, you can access the admin panel.

If you're a regular user, you might be restricted from accessing sensitive pages
